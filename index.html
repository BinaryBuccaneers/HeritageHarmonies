Title: Universal User Interface (UUI)
Description: 
Url: http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/Xholon.html?app=bf9f46947af55015be4a&src=gist&gui=none

My Notes
--------
To run this app (assuming you are using editwb.html to view this workbook):
- Click the "none" button above
  - A Xholon runtime page will open in a separate tab or window
  - It will execute the app defined in this workbook
  - The page will include a D3 Circle Pack SVG image
- Hover above each node to see its tooltip
  - Any node referenced by that context node will be displayed with an orange background
  - Any node that references that context node will be displayed with an orange border
- Click each node to see it's brief description in the out tab
- Right-click each node to see it's context menu

You can also run the app directly:

I already have an informal concept of a Universal User Interface (UUI), and many examples.
In this workbook I explore a bit more of what a UUI is.

The basic idea:
- all systems are structured as one or more graphs and/or trees
  - Xholon makes these structures explicit, but not necessarily visible
- a UUI makes these structures visible
  - all nodes
  - all relationships between parent and child nodes
  - all other graph relationships between nodes
- a UUI allows users to request any and all functionality these systems provide
- the same type of UUI can be used for any system

a previous coworker mentioned usability and functionality?
- I'm interested in a UUI that offers basic funtionality
  - that can then be extended to provide better usability
- a minimal UI that provides just enough to allow for the intended functionality
  - a solid base for building a UI with high usability

Some implementations of a UUI:
- D3 Circle Packing
- HTML div structures
- indentation, such as in the Xholon classic GUI
- paired parentheses
- 

The Xholon D3 Circle Packing GUI is a good example of a UUI:
- at any given time, one node is the context node
- external nodes have a single letter (with no circle)
  - instead of including the complete name of the node
  - all external node circles are the same size, just large enough to contain a single letter or symbol or icon
- internal nodes have a circle with one or more other nodes inside, but no letter
- adjacent nodes (nodes that the context node points to) are highlighted when the user hovers over a node
  - instead of using lines to show these graph relationships
- nodes that point to the context node are optionally highlighted in a different way
- the node's complete name is shown as a tooltip when the user hovers
- left-click any node to see it's toString() value in the out tab
- right-click any node to get a context menu
- tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes can be packed onto a computer screen
- structure is of primary importance, not the names of things
- the positions of things are always the same, from one run of the app to another
- the node's color can show what type of node it is
- clonons[18] are visible by their recurring shape
- any Xholon app, and any part of any Xholon app, can be displayed using D3 circle packing
- the result is a nicer presentation than with popular force-directed visualizations
- two-dimensional circle packing could be extended to three-dimensional sphere packing
- D3 uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which allows objects to be arbitrarily and vanishingly small
  - so the only limit to how nodes can be on the screen is the amount of memory in the computer
- a circle packing can be updated in-place each time step while an app is running
  - or a new circle packing can be displayed each time step, allowing comparison
  - the evolving circle packing can be written to a video file for subsequent replay
- 

Xholon example apps that demonstrate particularly well the D3 Circle Pack GUI:
    http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/Xholon.html?app=Cell&gui=d3cp

    http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/Xholon.html?app=Life&gui=d3cp

    http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/Xholon.html?app=11358183&src=gist&gui=d3cp

Ideas:

* our eyes only focus on a very small part of any diagram at any instant
  - the circle packing GUI would work well in a system with a camera that watched as our eyes move around on a page
  - the GUI would change as your eyes move
  - use of saccades
  - there's no need to present complete names of things on the screen until the user is looking directly at them
  - I could position the mouse at a context node, which would cause other nodes to become highlighted
   - as my eyes move around, I would see information about all the highlighted nodes
  - perhaps when my eye rests on a highlighted node, what it's connected to would also temporarily highlight
   - you could quickly glance about to see the overall connections

* need a good way to zoom in on a small part of a large circle packing without feeling sea sick

* use hardware acceleration; WebGL
  - circle packing with threejs ?

     "Enclosure diagrams use containment (nesting) to represent the hierarchy. The size of each leaf node’s circle reveals a quantitative dimension of each data point. The enclosing circles show the approximate cumulative size of each subtree, but note that because of wasted space there is some distortion between levels; only the leaf nodes can be compared accurately. Although circle packing does not use space as efficiently as a treemap, the “wasted” space more prominently reveals the hierarchy."
